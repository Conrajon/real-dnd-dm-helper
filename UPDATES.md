# In-app updates

The NSIS build includes **electron-updater**. On startup the app checks for a newer version; if one is available, users can download and install it from **Options → About**.

## Enabling updates for your users

1. **Build** the app (`BUILD-EXE.bat` or `npm run dist`).
2. **Host** the contents of the `installer/` folder on a web server or GitHub Releases:
   - `Real-DND-DM-Helper-Setup-<version>.exe`
   - `latest.yml` (generated by electron-builder)
3. In **package.json**, set `build.publish.url` to the base URL where those files are available (e.g. `https://your-site.com/releases` or a GitHub Releases URL).
4. Rebuild and release. Future builds will check that URL for updates.

## Behaviour

- **Packaged app only:** Update check runs only when the app is installed (not in `npm run start`).
- **User-triggered download:** Options → About → Check for updates; if available, user can download then quit and install.
- **Auto-install on quit:** When the update is downloaded, the app can quit and install on next launch (electron-updater default).

Editing source in the project folder does **not** change the installed app until you rebuild and either reinstall or use the in-app updater with a new version hosted at `build.publish.url`.
